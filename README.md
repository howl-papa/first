## Fashion Demand Analysis Script

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the script:

```bash
python3 fashion_demand_analysis.py
```

The script loads a CSV with `Date`, `SKU`, and `Demand`, filters the last 30 days for the selected SKU, and generates a demand chart and GPT-based insight saved to `analysis_result.pdf`.
